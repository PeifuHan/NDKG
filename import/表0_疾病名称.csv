Alzheimer disease,H00056,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta forms Ca2+ permeable pores and binds to and modulates multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5, and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress."
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy,H01185,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the deposition of congophilic material in the vessels of the cortex and leptomeninges. Although CAA most commonly appears in a sporadic form associated with aging, several familial forms of CAA reported to date. Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is a rare, fatal amyloid disease in young people in Iceland caused by a mutation in cystatin C, which is an inhibitor of several cysteine proteinases. It has also been reported that mutations in APP are linked to CAA."
Sturge-Weber syndrome,H01809,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare sporadic neurocutaneous syndrome the hallmark of which is a facial port-wine stain (PWS) involving the first division of the trigeminal nerve, ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomata, and angioma of the eye (leading to glaucoma). The clinical course is highly variable but usually progressive course in early childhood characterised by seizures, stroke-like episodes, headaches, neurological and cognitive deterioration, hemiparesis, glaucoma and visual field defects. Although patients with a PWS plus leptomeningeal involvement alone are generally diagnosed as having SWS, those with a facial PWS and glaucoma alone are usually classified separately or considered as having partial SWS. Leptomeningeal and choroidal vascular anomalies have also been described in the absence of a PWS and may represent another partial variant of SWS. A somatic activating missense mutation in the GNAQ gene was recently identified in affected tissues (both skin and brain). This gene encodes the Q-class G protein alpha-subunit, activation of which increases MAPK signaling. Standard treatment includes laser therapy for the birthmark, control of glaucoma through eyedrops or surgery, and the use of anticonvulsants. Treatment with an anticonvulsant or low-dose aspirin or both before the onset of seizures is an option."
Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy,H00606,"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), also known as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), is characterized by frequent tonic spasms of early onset within a few months of life, and a suppression-burst pattern in electroencephalography (EEG). Many causes have been considered for EIEE. It has been reported that 75% of the cases subsequently evolve to West syndrome, and later a much smaller number progress to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome."
Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy,H01815,"Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy (MMPSI) are rare, severe early infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy. The common clinical features are seizure onset within the first 6 months of life, occurrence of migrating polymorphic focal seizures, and progressive deterioration of psychomotor development. Seizures in MMPSI are refractory to conventional treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Early and multiple video/EEG recordings are critical to detect the characteristic multifocal and asynchronous long lasting ictal discharges and are essential for MMPSI diagnosis. MMPSI is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with few known etiologies. Recently, mutations of several genes have been reported in sporadic cases of MMPSI."
Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia,H02185,"The spondylometaphyseal dysplasias (SMD) are a group of short-stature disorders distinguished by abnormalities in the vertebrae and the metaphyses of the tubular bones. Aside from the most common SMD Kozlowski type (SMDK) and the second most common SMD corner fracture type (SMDCF), there are several rare subtypes and numerous unclassifiable cases of SMD."
Auriculocondylar syndrome,H01884,"Auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS) is a rare craniofacial malformation syndrome characterized by mandibular hypoplasia and question-mark ears (QME). QMEs, consisting of a specific defect at the lobe-helix junction, can also occur as an isolated anomaly. Studies have indicated the essential role of endothelin 1 (EDN1) signaling through the endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) in patterning the mandibular portion of the first pharyngeal arch. Mutations in the PLCB4 and GNAI3, predicted to function as signal transducers downstream of EDNRA, have recently been reported in ACS."
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA),H00063,"The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterised by loss of balance and motor coordination due to the primary dysfunction of the cerebellum. Compelling evidence points to major aetiological roles for transcriptional dysregulation, protein aggregation and clearance, autophagy, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, alterations of calcium homeostasis, mitochondria defects, toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanisms and eventual cell death with apoptotic features of neurons during SCA disease progression."
Isolated anhidrosis with normal sweat glands,H02281,"Anhidrosis is defined as the absence of perspiration in the presence of an appropriate stimulus such as heat, exercise, or pharmacological agonists. Isolated anhidrosis with normal sweat glands (ANHD) is very rare autosomal recessive anhidrosis. A homozygous missense mutation in ITPR2 has been identified in all affected family members. ITPR2 encodes a Ca2+ release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,H00264,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, also called hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), is a group of disorders characterized by a chronic motor and sensory polyneuropathy. Based on nerve conduction velocities, the disease can be divided into demyelinating CMT (CMT1), axonal CMT (CMT2) and intermediate CMT (CMTDI/CMTRI). Although more than 70 disease genes for CMT are known, a large number of affected individuals remain without a genetic diagnosis."
Type 1 diabetes mellitus,H00408,"The majority of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cases are believed to arise from an inflammatory, autoimmune attack against the beta cells in the pancreas, which consequently leads to the failure of insulin-mediated blood glucose regulation in the body. T1DM signs and symptoms can come on quickly and may include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss and so on. It is recognized that both genetic and environmental determinants are important in defining disease risk. The HLA class II genes are most strongly associated with T1DM. Another plausible candidate genes are INS, CTLA4 and PTPN22. The disease may be a result of variations in several susceptibility genes, with the majority only contributing weak effects."
Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome,H00469,"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDSs) are a group of heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders associated with a severe reduction in mitochondrial DNA in the affected tissues. The manifestations vary from tissue-specific mtDNA depletion to wide-spread multisystemic disorders. Some genes are known to underlie this group of disorders, and many disease genes are still unidentified. However, the disease mechanisms seem to be intimately associated with mtDNA replication and nucleotide pool regulation."
Progressive external ophthalmoplegia,H01118,"Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a progressive weakness of the external muscles of the eye resulting in blepharoptosis and ophthalmoparesis. Often other muscles are involved resulting in dysphagia and a variable neck and limb muscle weakness. Most sporadic PEO cases have an acquired genetic disease with a heteroplasmic large deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle. In familial PEO, several modes of inheritance occur. Patients may have a nuclear gene defect that predisposes to the accumulation of mtDNA deletions. Recently, mutations in such nuclear genes have been discovered. Some mutations are dominant (PEOA) and others recessive."
Thrombocytopenia (THC),H00978,"Thrombocytopenia is defined by a decrease in the number of platelets in circulating blood, resulting in the potential for increased bleeding and decreased ability for clotting. Inherited syndromes are relatively rare causes of thrombocytopenia, but some genes underlying these disorders have been elucidated. Some inherited syndromes predispose to the development of bone marrow failure or leukemia. For example, familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM) is characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects, and propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukemia."
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration,H00078,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a heterogeneous syndrome with the common feature being a relatively selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Multiple genes have been implicated in FTLD including microtubule associate protein tau (MAPT), progranulin (PGRN),Valosin-containing protein (VCP) and chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B). MAPT mutations are associated with tau pathology. Mutations in progranulin and valosin are associated with TDP-43 inclusions. The CHMP2B mutations are associated with ubiquitin-positive pathology."
Dilated cardiomyopathy,H00294,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (""familial"" DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of ""familial"" DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an ""idiopathic"" DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of ""idiopathic"" DCM focus on myocarditis induced by enterovirus and subsequent autoimmune myocardium impairments. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with ""idiopathic"" DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2+, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure."
Acne inversa,H00681,"Acne inversa (AI), also known as hidradenitis suppurativa, is a chronic inflammatory disorder of hair follicles involving the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body. Its characteristic features include recurrent formation of painful skin abscesses, fistulating sinuses, and disfiguring scars."
Congenital myopathy,H01810,"The congenital myopathies are a group of genetic muscle disorders characterised clinically by hypotonia and weakness, usually from birth, and a static or slowly progressive clinical course. Congenital myopathies are mainly defined by the predominant histopathological features which include nemaline rods, central cores, multiple minicores, central nuclei, and selective hypotrophy of type 1 fibres. Based on these features, individual congenital myopathies such as nemaline myopathy, central core disease, multi-minicore disease, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber type disproportion were reported. Over the past decade there have been major advances in defining the genetic basis of the majority of congenital myopathy subtypes. However the relationship between each congenital myopathy, defined on histological grounds, and the genetic cause is complex. Many of the congenital myopathies are due to mutations in more than one gene, and mutations in the same gene can cause different muscle pathologies."
Prune belly syndrome,H02129,"Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by deficient or absent abdominal wall musculature, hypotonia, ectasia of the urinary system, and bilateral intra-abdominal testes. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) has been described from patients with a PBS-like syndrome. CHRM3 encodes the major receptor mediating urinary bladder contraction upon micturition."
Long QT syndrome,H00720,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channels. LQTS is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a propensity to torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia frequently leading to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death usually in young otherwise healthy individuals. Anesthesia in a patient with LQTS can trigger malignant arrhythmias and is therefore a high-risk procedure. There are two well-known syndromes with a long QT interval. The Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by an autosomal-dominant inheritance without familial deafness. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) has an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance and is associated with deafness."
Brugada syndrome,H00728,"The Brugada syndrome (BRS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Mutations in nine genes (SCN5A, GPD1L, CACNA1C, CACNB2, SCN1B, KCNE3, SCN3B, HCN4, and KCND3) are known to cause BRS. In approximately 20% of the cases BRS is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with movement abnormalities or hypotonia,H02397,Neurodevelopmental disorder (NED) with movement abnormalities or hypotonia is a group of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of them have complications in addition to movement abnormalities or hypotonia. Several underlying genetic causes of these diseases have been identified.
Primary aldosteronism,H01603,"Primary aldosteronism is a clinical syndrome characterized by excess secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. It is manifested by hypertension and hyporeninemia. In the past, hypokalemia was thought to be a mandatory finding in primary aldosteronism. However, later studies confirmed that most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism among nonselected hypertensive persons is between 5% and 13%, and it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. There are the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma, and familial hyperaldosteronism (type I and typeII) are unusual subtypes. Somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D have been described in APAs. Usually, adenomas are managed surgically and bilateral hyperplasia, medically."
Sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness,H02636,"Sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness (SANDD) is a genetic disease characterized by a low heart beat and severe-to-profound deafness. A mutation of CACNA1D, encoding the Cav1.3 protein, has been identified in families with SANDD."
Cone-rod dystrophy and cone dystrophy,H00481,"Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) and cone dystrophy (COD) are a subgroup of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptor function. In contrast to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), deterioration of the cone cells is more severe than the rod cells. In CORD, there is a progressive loss of cone photoreceptor function followed by gradual loss of rod photoreceptor function and retinal degeneration. In COD, cone function decreases progressively from its onset, though rod function is well preserved until the late stages of the disease."
Aland Island eye disease,H00690,"Aland Island eye disease (AIED) is an X-linked form of ocular hypopigmentation. Affected males demonstrate nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, myopia, astigmatism, achromatopsia, and fundus hypopigmentation."
Congenital stationary night blindness,H00787,"Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of nonprogressive retinal disorders characterized by impaired night vision. CSNB is currently associated with X-linked genes (NYX, CACNA1F), autosomal recessive genes (CABP4, GRK1, GRM6, SAG, TRPM1), and autosomal dominant genes (GNAT1, PDE6B, RHO). Two types of CSNB can be distinguished by use of the standard flash electroretinogram (ERG). CSNB type 1 (CSNB1) is characterized by the complete absence of rod pathway function, whereas CSNB type 2 (CSNB2) is caused by impaired rod and cone pathway function. Oguchi disease is a form of CSNB. Patients with the Oguchi disease have a unique yellowish-gold fundus that regains its normal color after prolonged dark adaptation. That is called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon."
Periodic paralysis,H00215,"The periodic paralyses are characterized by episodic muscle weakness often related to potassium levels. They include hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP), and Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) caused by mutations in genes encoding for subunits of channel proteins of the skeletal muscle membrane."
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis,H00746,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP) is a member of periodic paralyses, an autosomal dominant genetic disorders caused by mutations in the sodium and calcium channel genes in skeletal muscle. In general, HOKPP is characterized by reversible attacks of muscle weakness concomitant with decreased blood potassium concentrations. HypoPP is associated with point mutations in both CACNA1S (HOKPP1) and SCN4A (HOKPP2)."
Malignant hyperthermia,H02646,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle most often associated with the administration of volatile general anesthetic agents and/or the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. MH is likely to be fatal if untreated. In most cases, MH is caused by a defect in the ryanodine receptor."
Autosomal dominant intellectual developmental disorder,H00773,"Intellectual developmental disorder, formerly known as Mental retardation (MR), is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotient (IQ) and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Most causative genes identified so far are either located on the X chromosome or are associated with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Recently, a lot of genes associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation have been identified."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with glutamatergic synapse dysfunction,H02705,Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and mediates its actions via activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic receptor families. Recent studies have shown that rare mutations in glutamate receptors and synaptic scaffold proteins are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
Landau-Kleffner syndrome,H01514,"Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is an epileptic encephalopathy that usually manifests itself in children aged 3-8 years with previously normal development. All LKS patients have abnormal EEG that is compatible with the diagnosis of epilepsy, however, only 70% have clinical seizures. The main symptoms are acute or subacute aphasia with inability to recognise, process or interpret verbal and/or non-verbal sounds. Although the exact etiology of LKS remains unclear, families with mutations in the GRIN2A gene have been described, in which some members have LKS. Recent reports have implicated susceptibility genes (SRPX2, ELP4) to idiopathic focal epilepsies."
"Rolandic epilepsy, mental retardation, and speech dyspraxia",H01827,"Rolandic epilepsy is the mostequent childhood focal epilepsy. Mutations in GRIN2A has been detected in atypical rolandic epilepsy associated with verbal dyspraxia or with dysphasia. Recently, SRPX2 has been identified as being responsible for rolandic epilepsy associated with speech dyspraxia and mental retardation."
Myocardial infarction,H01730,"Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a term for an event of heart attack. It is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack. Nitroglycerin and antihypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may also be used to lower blood pressure and to improve the oxygen demand of heart."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with defects of ubiquitin-proteasome system,H02715,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major proteolytic system that controls protein degradation and it regulates many cellular processes, such as cell division, gene expression and signal transduction. Many neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the UPS have been reported."
Proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndrome,H02532,"Proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (PRAAS) is also known as Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE). PRAAS is a rare autoinflammatory interferonopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in proteasome genes. In contrast to what occurs in many other autoinflammatory diseases, patients with PRAAS do not respond to IL-1 inhibition."
"Deafness, cataract, impaired intellectual development, and polyneuropathy",H02634,"Deafness, cataract, impaired intellectual development, and polyneuropathy (DCIDP) is a novel autosomal recessive syndrome with varying degrees of neurosensorial dysfunctions. DCIDP is caused by mutations in PSMC3 gene, encoding the proteasome ATPase subunit Rpt5. The proteasome is a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins to maintain cellular protein homeostasis and to control the abundance of many regulatory molecules."
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,H00766,"Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neonatal insulin-requiring diabetes and associated with skeletal dysplasia and growth retardation. Diabetes appears during the first months of life in most patients and major skeletal manifestations include the long bones, pelvis and vertebrae. Liver is also affected in the disease."
Myxoid liposarcoma,H00049,"Liposarcoma(LS) represents the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of adults and occurs most often in the thigh and retroperitoneum. LSs are subclassified into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic types. The myxoid type, the most common subtype, accounts for approximately 40% to 54% of all liposarcomas. The karyotypic hallmark of myxoid LS is the t(12;16)(q13;p11), present cytogenetically in >90% of the cases. The translocation leads to the fusion of the DDIT3(CHOP) and FUS(TLS) genes at 12q13 and 16p11, respectively, and the generation of a FUS-DDIT3 hybrid protein. In 4 cases of myxoid LS, a variant chromosomal translocation has been described, t(12;22), in which DDIT3 fuses instead with EWSR1(EWS), a gene highly related to TLS."
Bipolar disorder,H01653,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified."
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,H01813,"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple seizure types, typical findings in the electroencephalogram (EEG), and delayed psychomotor development. Tonic seizures during sleep are the feature often used as the foundation for diagnosis. LGS is characterized by multiple concurrent seizure types, including tonic, atypical absence seizures, atonic, and myoclonic jerks. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, lasting days to weeks, occurs in half of patients. The etiology of LGS is heterogeneous and includes both genetic and acquired causes. LGS most commonly first manifests in children between 3 and 5 years of age, but onset can also occur at younger and older ages. It has been reported that 20-36% of children diagnosed with LGS syndrome have a history of West syndrome."
Achromatopsia,H00971,"Achromatopsia (Rod monochromacy/ACHM) is an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy with a prevalence of 1 in 33,000 individuals. It is characterized by low visual acuity, photophobia, nystagmus, difficulty in color discrimination, and no recordable cone function in electroretinography with normal rod functions. The condition is caused by genetic defects affecting crucial components of the cone photoreceptor signaling."
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,H00005,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is caused by the abnormal progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. It is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, accounting for about 30% of total leukaemias. Worldwide there are approximately 180,000 new cases every year. A main focus in CLL research involved the evaluation of genetic features related to somatic gene mutation or deletions that disrupt apoptosis and enhance tumor cell proliferation. The best characterized genes are TP53 (also known as p53) and ATM, for which mutations and/or deletions have been described that predict rapid disease progression, resistance to conventional therapies and poor survival."
Hodgkin lymphoma,H00007,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)."
Adult T-cell leukemia,H00009,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies and is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The HTLV-1 Tax protein has been demonstrated to be the oncogenic protein of the virus. Tax may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including upregulating the expression of cellular genes involved in T cell growth and proliferation, including IL-2, IL-2R-alpha, and IL-15. However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression. This finding suggests that epigenetic change, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in the leukemogenesis of ATL."
Esophageal cancer,H00017,"Esophageal cancer represents the 9th leading cancer in the world and is associated with a 5-year survival rate under 25%. The two main forms are squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). ESCC is the most frequent histological subtype in esophageal cancer, although the incidence of EAC is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the western world. Whereas ESCC can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the most important risk factor for the development of EAC is duodenal-gastric-esophageal reflux. In the process of tumorigenesis at the cellular level, multiple genetic alterations are involved, including mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of cyclin D1 gene, among others."
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes,H00108,"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes (ALPS) are autosomal dominant disorders with clinical features of various autoimmune manifestations that predominantly involve polyclonal accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes with lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, and expansion of double-negative (DN) T cells in the peripheral blood. Central to the cellular pathogenesis is defective FAS-induced apoptosis, which in turn leads to dysregulation of lymphocyte homeostasis. ALPS caused by heterozygous mutations in the Fas gene (ALPS Type Ia) make up the majority of identified cases. However, other mutations, namely of the FasL gene (ALPS Type Ib) and the caspase 8 and 10 genes (ALPS Type II) are occasionally detected, whereas some patients do not present any known mutations (ALPS-III). Recently, mutations of the NRAS gene have been suggested to cause ALPS Type IV."
Mycosis fungoides,H01463,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), which are a heterogeneous group of malignancies derived from skin-homing T cells. MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases. Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis."
Disorders of innate immunity,H02525,Innate immune responses represent the first line of defense against potentially invading organisms. Disorders of innate immunity (e.g. phagocyte and complement disorders) delay the induction of the immune response and may worsen outcomes of infection.
Hepatocellular carcinoma,H00048,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer and one of the rare human neoplasms etiologically linked to viral factors. It has been shown that, after HBV/HCV infection and alcohol or aflatoxin B1 exposure, genetic and epigenetic changes occur. The recurrent mutated genes were found to be highly enriched in multiple key driver signaling processes, including telomere maintenance, TP53, cell cycle regulation, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (CTNNB1 and AXIN1), the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Recent studies using whole-exome sequencing have revealed recurrent mutations in new driver genes involved in the chromatin remodelling (ARID1A and ARID2) and the oxidative stress (NFE2L2) pathways."
Colorectal cancer,H00020,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC)."
Bladder cancer,H00022,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)."
Penile cancer,H00025,"Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These alterations have been described in both HPV-positive and -negative penile cancers."
Cervical cancer,H00030,"Cervical cancer is the second largest cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, and it occurs following persistent infection, sometimes for decades, with a specific subset of human papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly types 16, 18, 33 and 42. Experimental studies show that the E6 and E7 genes of these high risk HPVs are oncogenes that deregulate key cell cycle controls. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins bind respectively to the p53 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, which are involved in the regulation of growth control. The abnormalities in other cellular genes found in cervical cancer, including mutations in ras family of genes, and amplification in EGFR and ERBB2, may also play an important role in carcinogenesis and the aggressiveness of cervical tumors, although to date the role of most of these genetic abnormalities does not appear to be as important as the role of HPV."
Thyroid cancer,H00032,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and accounts for the majority of endocrine cancer- related deaths each year. More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells. Their behavior varies from the indolent growing, well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas (PTC and FTC, respectively) to the extremely aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma (UC). Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. The most distinctive molecular features of FTC are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR{gamma} rearrangements. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma."
Squamous cell carcinoma,H00040,"Non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent tumors and their number is still increasing world- wide. Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs. In addition to UV, a pathogenic role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of SCC has also been proposed."
Noonan syndrome and related disorders,H00523,"Noonan syndrome comprises genetically heterogeneous disorders that usually include postnatally reduced growth, distinctive facial dysmorphic features, and congenital heart defects and related disorders show considerable overlapping phenotypes with Noonan syndrome. These disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and are called RASopathies."
Giant cell tumor of bone,H01470,"Giant-cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a rare osteolytic tumor of the bone. Although classified as a benign tumor, GCTB is characterized by local aggressiveness and risk of local recurrence. Its name is derived from the numerous multinucleated giant cells found within the tumor, which are principally responsible for the extensive bone resorption that is characteristic of GCTB. However, the neoplastic components of GCTB are the spindle-like stromal cells, which produce RANKL that recruits monocytic osteoclast precursors from blood to the tumor, and stimulates differentiation into multinucleated giant cells. Recently, denosumab (RANKL inhibitor) has become a new treatment option for locally advanced GCTB."
Merkel cell carcinoma,H01555,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy that exhibits clinically aggressive features and is associated with a poor prognosis. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a cause, and corresponds with the sites of these tumours, often on sun-exposed skin, mostly (94%) in the White population. UV light may exert local immunomodulating action as it decreases amount of epidermal T cells and Langerhans cells, inducing hapten tolerance. Additionally, UV- specific mutations in TP53 and Harvey (Ha)-RAS genes are present in some MCC cell lines. Recently, the polyomavirus group has been linked with MCC. The MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) has been isolated from MCC tissue and thought to be present in up to 80% of MCC. Tumorigenesis likely is caused by a number of sequential steps from viral integration into host DNA, mutagenic events, and specific immune responses."
Medullary thyroid cancer,H01592,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells and accounts for only <5% of thyroid cancers, but it causes a disproportionate number of thyroid cancer deaths due to its more aggressive clinical behavior compared with well-differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas. A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors. In MTC, RET mutations lead to substrate-independent dimerization of the receptor causing constitutive activation, unrestricted signaling, and ultimately, cancer."
Angiosarcoma,H01666,"Angiosarcomas are rare, generally aggressive, malignant mesenchymal tumours of vascular origin and constitute less than 1% of all sarcomas. Their most frequent site of origin is the head and neck, especially the scalp, of elderly men. Angiosarcomas are likely derived from vascular endothelial cells, possibly resulting from aberrant angiogenesis. Studies have shown relatively increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFr1-3) in human angiosarcoma. The most common gene mutation in angiosarcomas is KRAS as well as other RAS mutations. Activation of the RAS pathway is often tumorigenic. Although immortalised murine endothelial cells form benign haemangiomas in vivo, the addition of activated HRAS produces rapidly growing, poorly differentiated angiosarcomas."
Costello syndrome,H01747,"Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare multiple congenital abnormality syndrome. Patients present with the typical coarse face, deep palmar and plantar creases, redundant and loose skin, severe failure to thrive, congenital heart defect, and mild to severe mental retardation. Hyperpigmentation and papillomas can also be present. They have an increased risk of malignancy. The majority of patients show a mutation in HRAS."
Epidermal nevus,H02627,Epidermal nevus is hamartomatous lesions derived from the epidermis and/or adnexal structures of the skin. It is often present at birth or within the first few years of life.
Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome,H02628,"Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by sebaceous nevus associated with extracutaneous abnormalities affecting the brain, eyes, and bones."
Acute myeloid leukemia,H00003,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated."
Multiple myeloma,H00010,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression."
Non-small cell lung cancer,H00014,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect."
Oral cancer,H00016,"Oral cancer refers to a subgroup of head and neck malignancies that develop at the lips, tongue, salivary glands, gingiva, floor of the mouth, oropharynx, buccal surfaces and other intra-oral locations, according to the International Classification of Diseases. Nevertheless, the term is synonymous to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of oral mucosal origin that accounts for more than 90% of all malignant presentations at the aforementioned anatomical sites. Worldwide, oral SCC (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer; more than 300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. The development of OSCC is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, influenced by a patient's genetic predisposition as well as by environmental influences, including tobacco, alcohol, chronic inflammation, and viral infection. The genetic changes include activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alterations of tumor suppressors p53 and p16, and cyclin D1 overexpression."
Gastric cancer,H00018,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the world's most common cancers. According to Lauren's histological classification gastric cancer is divided into two distinct histological groups - the intestinal and diffuse types. Several genetic changes have been identified in intestinal-type GC. The intestinal metaplasia is characterized by mutations in p53 gene, reduced expression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR-beta) and hTERT expression. Gastric adenomas furthermore display mutations in the APC gene, reduced p27 expression and cyclin E amplification. In addition, amplification and overexpression of c-ErbB2, reduced TGF-beta receptor type I (TGFBRI) expression and complete loss of p27 expression are commonly observed in more advanced GC. The main molecular changes observed in diffuse-type GCs include loss of E-cadherin function by mutations in CDH1and amplification of MET and FGFR2F."
Pancreatic cancer,H00019,"Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors. The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway."
Endometrial cancer,H00026,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the developed world after breast, colorectal and lung cancer. Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy, p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplification."
Ovarian cancer,H00027,"Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in developed countries. Approximately 90% of human ovarian cancer arises within the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), with the rest originating from granulosa cells or, rarely, stroma or germ cells. Ovarian epithelial tumors are divided into mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell subtypes. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers arise in women who have inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). The vast majority of ovarian cancers are sporadic, resulting from the accumulation of genetic damage over a lifetime. Several specific genes involved in ovarian carcinogenesis have been identified, including the p53 tumor suppressor gene and ERBB2 and PIK3CA oncogenes."
Kaposi sarcoma,H00041,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disease classified into classic KS, endemic KS, iatrogenic KS, and HIV-associated KS (HIV-KS), however, they share the same histological traits and are all associated with infection by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8; also known as KSHV). Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects."
Cholangiocarcinoma,H00046,"Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that carries a poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy. It is the second most common primary hepatic tumor, and it is increasing in incidence and carries a high mortality. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree, either within the liver (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: ICC) or more commonly from the extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Several studies have demonstrated mutations resulting in overexpression of K-ras and p53 genes. These genetic alterations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype in this cancer. Many reports have implicated overexpression of the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogenes c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and c-Met, as well as cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma."
Gallbladder cancer,H00047,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively uncommon neoplasm, however its prognosis is poor with less than a 5% 5-year survival rate. There are considerable geographic differences in its incidence and etiology. Two main pathways of GBC pathogenesis have been identified. The most common is associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, whereas a second, less frequent pathway is associated with a congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction, which is particularly common in Japan. TP53 inactivation has an important and early role in GBC associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation. Although KRAS mutations are rarely detected in GBC associated with gallstones, they are frequent and early events in tumors associated with congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction."
Syndromic craniosynostoses,H00458,Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the cranial sutures and secondary distortion of skull shape. Syndromic craniosynostosis typically involves cranial sutures plus central nervous system and extracranial skeletal changes. The genes most frequently mutated are FGFRs.
Hepatic angiosarcoma,H01557,"Angiosarcoma represents 1 to 2% of soft tissue tumors. It originates from endothelial cells of small blood vessels and may affect a variety of organs, including the retroperitoneum, skeletal muscle, subcutis, liver, heart and breast. Primary hepatic angiosarcomas (HAS) are much rare tumors, with worse prognosis compared with other angiosarcomas. HAS has been found to be caused by occupational exposure to vinyl chloride (VC) monomer since 1970, and the number of VC-associated HAS cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. Exposure of VC connects with a series of mechanistic events leading to carcinogenic outcome; mutations of K-ras and p53 are also detected."
Noonan syndrome,H01738,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, congenital cardiac defects, cryptorchidism in men, coagulation defects, and neurocognitive delay. In addition, individuals with NS have an increased risk of developing cancer. NS is caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Heterozygous, pathogenic variants in 9 known genes account for approximately 80% of cases. The most common gene associated with NS is PTPN11, which accounts for approximately 50% of all cases."
Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome,H01745,"Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by short stature, a characteristic face, cardiac defects, developmental delay and mental retardation. Affected individuals present with ectodermal abnormalities such as sparse, friable hair, hyperkeratotic skin lesions and a generalized ichthyosis-like condition. Typical facial characteristics include high forehead, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a depressed nasal bridge, and posteriorly angulated ears. CFC can be caused by mutations in BRAF, KRAS, MEK1, and MEK2, encoding components of the RAS-MAPK pathway."
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms,H02410,"Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) are hybrid group of chronic myeloid neoplasms combining features of both myelodysplastic (MDS) [DS: H01481 ] and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This group includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), its pediatric counterpart juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), MDS/MPN with ringed sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), atypical BCR-ABL1 negative chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and MDS/MPN- unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-u). Somatic mutations observed in MDS/MPN fall in 4 major categories, including signaling, splicing, epigenetic, and transcription gene mutations."
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,H02411,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with peripheral blood monocytosis, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation. CMML has overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [DS: H01481 ] and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Gene mutations are seen in >90% of patients, with common abnormalities involving; epigenetic regulators (TET20% and ASXL1 -40%), spliceosome components (SRSF2 -50%), transcription factors (RUNX1 -15%) and cell signaling (RAS -30%, CBL -15%)."
Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia,H02412,"Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is a rare subtype of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). It is characterized by leukocytosis, granulocytic dysplasia, and typically poor patient outcomes. aCML is dominated by mutations in SETBP1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R), NRAS and KRAS. In addition to these mutations, other recurrent mutations in a variety of genes including NRAS, IDH2, and CBL have recently been described in aCML at lower frequencies."
Erdheim-Chester disease,H02425,"Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans-cell form of histiocytosis characterized by infiltration of tissues by foamy histiocytes. Among the more common sites of involvement are the skeleton, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidneys (retroperitoneum) and skin. Recent studies have described that the etiology of ECD may be associated with the V600E BRAF mutation and an array of other activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations, suggesting a critical role of this pathway in the pathogenesis and a possible clonal origin of the disease."
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,H02541,Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare clonal hematopoietic disorder of early childhood with features characteristic of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders. Recent studies have shown that abnormal proliferation is due to aberrant signal transduction resulting from mutations in components of the RAS-signaling pathway.
Adrenal carcinoma,H00033,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy defined by a heterogeneous clinical presentation, dismal prognosis, and lack of effective therapeutic regimens. The incidence of ACC ranges from 0.5 to 2 cases per million people per year, accounting for 0.02% of all reported cancers. Unfortunately, most patients present with metastatic disease which reduces the 5 year survival rate to less than 10%. Oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in adrenal carcinomas include mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and rearrangements of the chromosomal locus 11p15.5 associated with IGF II hyperexpression. Deletions of the ACTH receptor gene have recently been found in undifferentiated adenomas and in aggressive ACCs."
Melanoma,H00038,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways. MITF and TP53 are implicated in further melanoma progression."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,H01512,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation of specialized cells with characteristics resembling antigen-presenting cells that reside in the skin and mucosa. Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology."
Leopard syndrome,H01984,"LEOPARD syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder belonging to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS-MAPK signalling diseases. Its main features are lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth and deafness. Approximately 90% of LEOPARD syndrome cases are caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. But it may also be caused by mutations in RAF1 or BRAF."
Melorheostosis,H02631,Melorheostosis (MEL) is a rare sclerosing hyperostosis characterized by asymmetric bone overgrowth and functional impairment. Recent studies indicate that most cases arise from somatic MAP2K1 mutations although a small number may arise from other genes in related pathways.
Common variable immunodeficiency,H00088,"There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (c) CVID, also called acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, adult-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, or dysgammaglobulinemia, is a heterogeneous group of disorders involving both B-cell and T-cell immune function, the predominant manifestation of which is hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, decreased serum Ig levels, and abnormal antibody responses. The mutated genes that produce the CVID phenotype are known only for a minority of patients, and they are diverse in their influence on immune function. Homozygous mutations in ICOS are clearly the cause of disease. Heterozygous mutations in the TNF receptor family member TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor) can be found in up to 10% of patients with CVID."
Chronic mucocutaneous ulceration,H02593,"Chronic mucocutaneous ulceration (CMCU) is characterized by oral and gastrointestinal ulcerations, cytopenias, and lymphoproliferative disease. It has been reported that a heterozygous mutation in RELA, encoding the NF-kB subunit RelA, causes CMCU."
Asthma,H00079,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation."
Systemic lupus erythematosus,H00080,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components, in association with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particularly in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases. It has been reported that there is a relatively high genetic component behind SLE. The data of family-based studies point toward an oligogenic background, with several susceptibility genes (SLEB) acting on disease expression along with environmental factors."
Allograft rejection,H00083,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nonetheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft."
Graft-versus-host disease,H00084,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where immunocompetent donor T cells attack the genetically disparate host cells. GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. During step 3, the effector phase, activated CTL and NK cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through Fas-Fas ligand interactions and perforin-granzyme B."
Malaria,H00361,"Malaria, the most common parasitic disease in the world, is caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted by female Anopheline mosquitoes. Plasmodium infections result in a spectrum of clinical effects, including asymptomatic parasitemia, severe malaria, and death. Most severe cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. In severe malaria, complications such as anemia, respiratory distress, renal failure, and cerebral malaria are observed in addition to cyclical fevers."
Crohn disease,H00286,"Crohn disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by granulomatous inflammation, primarily localized to the terminal ileum. Most patients have involvement of the small intestine, but the other area of gastrointestinal tract may also be affected. In Western populations, over 50% of patients possess NOD2 mutations. Evidence exists that the NOD2 polymorphisms impair NF-kappaB activation and cytokine secretion in response to its ligand. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is also attributed to intestinal bacteria that may initiate mucosal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals. Additional genes associated with the disease are recently being identified."
Rheumatoid arthritis,H00630,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the ""shared epitope"" (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA."
Castleman disease,H01479,"Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder with two primary subtypes that vary in presentation and course. Unicentric Castleman disease is localized and carries an excellent prognosis. Multicentric Castleman disease can be associated with HIV and human herpesvirus-8 and is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, anorexia, anemia, and cachexia. Castleman disease is unique in that dysregulated secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a central pathogenetic role, although the exact events precipitating the oversecretion of IL-6 are unknown. Recently, two antibody-based therapeutics targeting components of the IL-6/IL-6R complex have been approved for the treatment of Castleman disease. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, and siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody specific for IL-6."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,H01672,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA."
Chromosome 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome,H01877,"Chromosome 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders. The syndrome is caused by microdeletions in the 15q13.2q-13.3 region. This chromosomal region contains seven genes and is flanked by a breakpoint (BP) on each side. About 80% of patients with this syndrome have one or more neuropsychiatric diagnoses, including developmental disability/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, speech problems, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The neuropsychiatric phenotypes of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome have been proposed to be caused by haploinsufficiency of CHRNA7, which is one of the seven genes."

Lissencephaly,H00268,"Lissencephaly (LIS), literally meaning smooth brain, is a severe neuronal migration disorder that ranges from agyria/pachygyria to subcortical band heterotopia."
Parkinson disease,H00057,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively."
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),H00058,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In 90% of patients, ALS is sporadic, with no clear genetic linkage. On the other hand, the remaining 10% of cases show familial inheritance, with mutations in SOD1, TDP43(TARDBP), FUS, or C9orf72 genes being the most frequent causes. In spite of such difference, familial ALS and sporadic ALS have similarities in their pathological features. Proposed disease mechanisms contributing to motor neuron degeneration in ALS are: impaired proteostasis, aberrant RNA processing, mitochondrial disfunction and oxidative stress, microglia activation, and axonal dysfunction."
Progressive supranuclear palsy,H00077,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressing degenerative disease belonging to the family of tauopathies caused by abnormalities in the microtubule-associated protein, tau. PSP presents with an atypical parkinsonism characterized by progressive axial rigidity, vertical gaze palsy, dysarthria and dysphagia. Although the majority of cases of progressive supranuclear palsy appear to be sporadic, the scarcity of familial cases may lack of recognition of the variable phenotypic expression of PSP. One in every 100,000 Americans over the age of 60 have PSP and patients are usually middle-aged or elderly, and men are affected more often than women."
Leber hereditary optic atrophy,H00068,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally transmitted inherited genetic disease underlying mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It is primarily an ophthalmological disorder, presenting predominantly in young adult males and characterized by acute or subacute bilateral optic atrophy that results in the loss of central vision. In most of the patients with LHON, visual dysfunction is the only manifestation of the disease. The incidence of LHON in Western Europe is 1/30000-1/50000; at least 1 in 14000 males is affected."

RRFs are muscle fibers with subsarcolemmal mitochondria that stained red with Gomori trichrome stain. The MERRF syndrome is most commonly caused by the A8344G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA Lys gene."
Leigh syndrome,H01354,"Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Most frequently the central nervous system is affected, with psychomotor retardation, seizures, nystagmus, optic atrophy, ataxia, or respiratory failure. Some patients also present with peripheral nervous system involvement or non-neurologic abnormalities. In the majority of cases, dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex or of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are responsible for the disease. Patterns of inheritance include X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, and mitochondrial."
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency,H01368,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is a mitochondrial disease that is caused by the lack of the COX. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV). Since COX is encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes, COX deficiency can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or a maternal pattern. Patients can present with a number of different clinical phenotypes, including Leigh syndrome, Fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."
Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome,H01904,"Microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS) syndrome is an X-linked male-lethal disorder, also known as MIDAS syndrome (microphthalmia, dermal aplasia, and sclerocornea), or Linear skin defects with multiple congenital anomalies (LSDMCA).

Diseases of the tricarboxylic acid cycle,H01022,"Diseases of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) constitute a group of rare human diseases that affect core mitochondrial metabolism. The Fumarase deficiency is caused by impairment of the fumarate hydratase enzyme. The symptoms of the disorder include developmental delay, severe mental retardation, language impairment, seizures and dysmorphic facial features. The succinate dehydrogenase deficiency [DS: H02005 ] affects mitochondrial complex II, which links the TCA cycle with the electron transport chain. The phenotype is highly variable and can include Leigh syndrome, leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and mental and motor skill deterioration. The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency is extremely rare and characterised by encephalopathy and hyperlactatemia resulting in death in early childhood."
Mitochondrial complex II deficiency,H02005,"Mitochondrial complex II (CII, succinate dehydrogenase complex) deficiency is a rare cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defects. CII functions in the TCA cycle and in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Four structural subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) and two known assembly factor genes (SDHAF1 and SDHAF2) are all nuclear-encoded. Mutations in SDHA, SDHD, and SDHAF1 have been found in patients. CII deficiency has a variable phenotype. Brain imaging is abnormal in majority of the patients and consists of leukoencephalopathy, Leigh syndrome or cerebellar atrophy."

Germ line PTEN mutations have been found in 85% of those with CS. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time. In the absence of germline PTEN mutations, approximately 10% of individuals with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome harbor germline succinate dehydrogenase variants SDHB and SDHD."
Malignant paraganglioma,H01510,"Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia and derive from neural crest cells. Malignancy is defined by presence of metastases, tumor spread in sites where chromaffin tissue is normally absent such as lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones. Malignant PGLs are extremely rare. The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways."
Gastrotintestinal stromal tumor,H01591,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract, arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal, or their precursor stem cells. GISTs account for about 80% of gastrointestinal sarcomas, with a mean annual incidence of 10-15 per million. Nearly 50-70% of the clinically apparent tumors arise in the stomach, 20-30% arise in the small intestine, 5-15% in the large intestine, and less than 5% in other locations. The genetic basis of GIST growth is a mutation of the KIT or PDGFRA gene leading to constitutional activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is the driving force behind tumor development."
Carcinoid,H00034,"Carcinoid tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms that nonetheless comprise up to 85% of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal neoplasms. They most frequently occur in the midgut and develop from neuroendocrine cells that are normally and diffusely present in this location. Most carcinoids are sporadic but epidemiological studies report a familial risk. Moreover, carcinoids can occur within the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, a rare familiar tumor syndrome in which mutations in the MEN1 gene are manifested. Recently, it has been shown that a majority (78%) of sporadic carcinoids display loss of heterozygosity for markers around the MEN 1 region, thus suggesting involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic carcinoids."
"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dyserythropoietic anemia, and calvarial hyperostosis",H00920,"Patients with this disease suffer from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dyserythropoietic anemia, and calvarial hyperostosis.

The clinical presentations of MTP-affected individuals vary considerably and range from no symptoms to a severe bleeding tendency. MTP-causing mutations have been reported in several genes, involved in various functions such as cell signaling, cytoskeleton organization, and gene expression. Among these, the most common is MYH9, which is responsible for MYH9-related disease. The second most common are GP1BA, GP1BB, and GP, which are responsible for Bernard-Soulier syndrome."
Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases,H01579,"Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases, also known as Michelin tire baby syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized folding of excess skin. This feature was first described in 1969, then subsequent reports described variable additional features, such as intellectual disability (ID), facial dysmorphism, and cardiac and genital anomalies. It has been reported that mutations in either MAPRE2 or TUBB underlie the genetic origin of this syndrome. MAPRE2 encodes a member of the microtubule end-binding family of proteins that bind to the guanosine triphosphate cap at growing microtubule plus ends, and TUBB encodes a beta-tubulin isotype that is expressed abundantly in the developing brain."
Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles,H00838,"Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) describes a group of rare congenital eye movement disorders that result from the dysfunction of all or part of the oculomotor (CN 3) and the trochlear (CN 4) nerves, and/or the muscles these nerves innervate. CFEOM is characterized by non-progressive, restrictive ophthalmoplegia of the extraocular muscles and congenital blepharoptosis. Several clinical phenotypes for familial CFEOM have been delineated."
Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy,H00679,"Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HMLs) are disorders involving aberrant myelin formation in the central nervous system. They are clinically characterized by early onset nystagmus, impaired motor development, ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, dysarthria and progressive limb spasticity. The prototype of primary HMLs is the X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) caused by mutations in PLP1 encoding proteolipid protein lipophilin. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) is clinically similar to classical PMD but is not associated with PLP1 mutations. PMLD appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and mutations have been identified in GJC2, AIMP1, HSPD1 and so on."
Primary dystonia,H00831,"Dystonias are a heterogeneous group of hyperkinetic movement disorders characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contractions that lead to abnormal postures and repetitive movements. Presently, 30 distinct monogenic primary dystonias have been recognized.

Leber congenital amaurosis,H00837,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a heterogeneous group of severe retinal degenerations, which typically becomes evident in the first year of life. Affected infants have little or no retinal photoreceptor function as tested by electroretinography. LCA is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and caused by mutations in more than a dozen genes. Several have been demonstrated as potentially efficacious gene therapy targets."
Congenital facial palsy with ptosis and velopharyngeal dysfunction,H02594,"Congenital facial palsy with ptosis and velopharyngeal dysfunction (FPVEPD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in TUBB6, a gene encoding a class V tubulin. Tubulins form microtubules, which are essential for the cytoskeleton and thereby for cell division, differentiation and migration as well as intracellular trafficking."
Oocyte/zygote/embryo maturation arrest,H01897,"Human reproduction requires gamete maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. Oocyte maturation includes nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, and abnormalities in the process will lead to infertility. Currently, several genes have been reported to be the causes of Oocyte/zygote/embryo maturation arrest (OZEMA)."
Parkinsonian syndrome,H01600,"Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) are multisystemic diseases that produce not only motor and cognitive function impairment, but also other disorders that require the intervention of specialists other than the neurologist. PS include idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), among other rarer causes of parkinsonism. Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset."
"Immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation",H02792,"Immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation (IDAA) is a new immune dysregulation disease. It has been reported that a gain-of-function mutation in PLCG1 causes this disease. PLCG1 encodes phospholipase C gamma 1, an enzyme activated by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce critical second messengers, including diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)."
Lewy body dementia (LBD),H00066,"Lewy Body dementia (LDB) is neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, mild parkinsonism, and fluctuations in attention and alertness. It is the second most-common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy Bodies is seen in the brainstem, the limbic system or cortical and subcortical regions, depending on disease subtype. The genetic risk factors include alpha-synuclein mutations and SNCA locus triplication. Mutations of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have also been implicated in familial DLB."
3-Methylglutaconic aciduria,H00754,3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (MGCA) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid and 3-methylglutaric acid. Nine distinct forms of MGCA have been recognized.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,H00045,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), also known as islet cell tumors, are rare neoplasms that arise in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas. They may occur sporadically or in association with a genetic syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Von Hippel-Landau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, or tuberous sclerosis. The most frequent genetic alterations in PNET occur in MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia-1 Gene), DAXX/ATRX (Death-Domain Associated Protein/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked Genes) and the mTOR pathway (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin). A germline mutation in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene causes MEN1, the above-mentioned autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome. Mutations of DAXX and ATRX are common and related to altered telomeres but not to prognosis."
Dopa-responsive dystonia,H02557,Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) encompasses a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that typically manifest as limb-onset dystonia that fluctuates diurnally and improves with levodopa treatment. DRD usually results from genetic defects in enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of dopamine. The most common condition is autosomal dominant GTP cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency (Segawa syndrome).
Brunner syndrome,H00548,"Brunner syndrome is a form of X-linked non-dysmorphic mild mental retardation. It is caused by a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) deficiency, which leads to an excess of monoamines in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine."

Mitochondrial complex III deficiency,H02086,"Mitochondrial complex III deficiency (MC3DN) is a relatively rare devastating disorder that impairs energy generation, and leads to variable symptoms such as developmental regression, seizures, kidney dysfunction and frequently death. Until now, mutations in nine genes have been known to cause CIII deficiency. CYC1, UQCRB, UQCRQ, and UQCRC2 encode components of CIII itself, whereas BCS1L, TTC19, LYRM7, UQCC2, and UQCC3 produce mitochondrial assembly factors."
Chronic myeloid leukemia,H00004,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1."
Hairy cell leukemia,H00006,"Hairy cell Leukemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that is defined, according to the WHO classification, as a mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasm. HCL accounts for between 2-3% of all leukemia cases, with about 600 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. With regard to genetic abnormalities of potential pathogenetic importance in HCL, only a few have been described. Mutations of p53 and Bcl-6 have been reported in about one-third of cases, but their functional significance is unclear. Over-expression of cyclin D1, an important cell cycle regulator, has been reported in cases of HCL as well as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and in a few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among lymphoid malignancies."
Burkitt lymphoma,H00008,"Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma consisting of endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated variants. Endemic BL (eBL) affects children and young adults in Africa and some other geographical areas and carries Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in more than 95% of cases. In contrast, sporadic BL (sBL) among adolescents in Europe and North America are mostly EBV-negative. A third type of BL is associated with HIV-infection in adults. All of these subtypes possess chromosomal rearrangements of the c-myc oncogene, the genetic hallmark of BL that contributes to lymphomagenesis through alterations in cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, cellular adhesion, and metabolism. Many BL carry point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or other defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, and inactivation of the p16INK4a gene by promoter methylation or homozygous deletion. This indicates that disruption of both the pRb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways is critical for BL development."
Small cell lung cancer,H00013,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control."
Malignant pleural mesothelioma,H00015,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs."
Choriocarcinoma,H00028,"Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant epithelial tumor that can be associated with any type of gestational event, most often a complete hydatidiform mole (CM). CM occur in about one per 1000 pregnancies, and about 5-20% of CM progress to invasive moles or choriocarcinoma. Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma. Moreover, choriocarcinomas have been shown to express increased concentrations of MMP and decreased concentrations of TIMP to help with tumor invasion and metastasis."
Vulvar cancer,H00029,"Vulvar cancer is a relatively uncommon malignancy, occurring at a rate of 2.2 per 100,000 women per year. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vulvar cancer and is observed in 80% to 90% of cases. There are at least two quite different types of SCC of the vulva. The less common, accounting for about one-third of cases, occurs in relatively young women, is usually preceded by the undifferentiated form of vulvar squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the more frequent form develops in elderly patients, is not commonly associated with undifferentiated VIN but is frequently associated with differentiated VIN, lichen sclerosus or squamous hyperplasia, and is generally not linked to HPV infection. Relatively little is known about molecular changes in the genesis of vulvar cancer. Some studies suggest that early p53 mutation may be a defining step only in HPV-negative tumors. A rather small study suggests that mutation in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is an early change in a substantial subset of vulvar carcinomas."
Breast cancer,H00031,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin, and EGFR) have been confirmed."
Osteosarcoma,H00036,"Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer. Approximately 900 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed each year in the United States. The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors. Alterations of Rb1 and c-myc are also common, and mutations have been reported in p53, p16INK4A, and CDKN2B."
Basal cell carcinoma,H00039,"Cancer of the skin is the most common cancer in Caucasians and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) account for 90% of all skin cancers. The vast majority of BCC cases are sporadic, though there is a rare familial syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, or Gorlin syndrome) that predisposes to development of BCC. In addition, there is strong epidemiological and genetic evidence that demonstrates UV exposure as a risk factor of prime importance. The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (>50%) in sporadic BCC."
Glioma,H00042,"Gliomas are the most common of the primary brain tumors and account for more than 40% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM."
Cancer of the anal canal,H00044,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal accounts for 1.5 per cent of all digestive system cancers in the USA, with an estimated 4,660 new cases and 660 deaths in 2006. Epidemiological and molecular-biology studies have now shown that sexually transmitted infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important aetiological agent. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also associated with anal cancer. HPV infection is transient in most immunocompetent individuals, but HIV-positive patients have evidence of persistent HPV infection within the anal canal. Current data suggest that mutations in p53, DCC and APC tumor suppressor genes contribute to the stepwise progression of anal squamous cell carcinoma in immunocompetent individuals."
Laryngeal cancer,H00055,"Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in Europe, with about 52,000 new cases per year, 90% of them occurring in men. Smoke and alcohol represent the major behavioral risk factors. Of all laryngeal cancers, some 95% are squamous cell carcinomas. Some molecular events have been described in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Although tumor suppressor inactivation of p53 and p16 is common in these tumors (about 50% each), oncogenic activation is less well characterized. Cyclin D1 and epidermal growth factor receptor amplification have been reported in one-third and one-quarter of LSCCs, respectively, both related to advanced stages, whereas c-myc could be amplified in 13% of cases although without associated overexpression."
Li-Fraumeni syndrome,H00881,"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial clustering of early onset tumors including sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas (ADR). Initially considered as a rare syndrome, LFS and its variants are increasingly recognized as one of the most frequent and diverse forms of predisposition to cancer. Most cases identified and characterized to date are associated with dominantly inherited germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (p53). In a subset of non-p53 patients with LFS, CHEK2 has been identified as another predisposing locus. LFS is diagnosed on the basis of the confirmed clinical diagnostic criteria."
Choroid plexus papilloma,H01007,"Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare intraventricular papillary neoplasms of neuroectodermal origin, accounting for less than 1% of all intracranial tumors and 2-4% of pediatric brain tumors. CPTs are categorized by three distinct histologies; choroid plexus papilloma, atypical choroid plexus papilloma, and the malignant choroid plexus carcinoma. Choroid plexus papillomas outnumber choroid plexus carcinomas and are composed of a single layer of cuboidal-to-columnar cells, resting on a basement membrane overlying papillary and vascularized connective tissue."
Mantle cell lymphoma,H01464,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and it accounts for about 6% of all NHL cases. Diagnosis is based on lymph node, bone marrow, or tissue morphology of centrocytic lymphocytes, small cell type, or blastoid variant cells. The molecular hallmark and putative initiating oncogenic event in MCL is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation resulting in constitutional overexpression of cyclin D1 and cell cycle dysregulation in almost all cases. Clinically, MCL shows an aggressive clinical course with a continuous relapse pattern and a median survival of only 3-5 years. However, recently a subset of 15% long-term survivors has been identified with a rather indolent clinical course."
Fallopian tube cancer,H01554,"Fallopian tube cancer is a rare, aggressive gynecologic malignancy. Recent genetic and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) involving the ovary likely arises from distal fallopian tube epithelium, indicating that some ovarian cancers develop in the fallopian tube and are then spread to the ovary. Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature). There is also some evidence that BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations and c-myc have a major role in tumorgenesis."
Oropharyngeal cancer,H01559,"Oropharyngeal cancer is a generic term that includes tumors arising within the anatomic confines of the posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, tonsillar region and posterior one-third (base) of the tongue. The vast majority of these tumors (>95%) includes squamous cell carcinomas of mucosal origin. Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) are traditionally categorized as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is now recognised as a causative agent in a subset of OPSCCs. HPV-driven OPSCC and tobacco- and alcohol-related OPSCC are biologically distinct entities. In the former, p53 and pRb are both inactivated at the protein level by, respectively, E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. The majority of HPV-negative tumors, instead, harbor mutations in the TP53 gene, an increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number and higher EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC)."
Medulloblastoma,H01667,"Medulloblastoma is the most common embryonal CNS tumor of childhood and is likely composed of biologically different subsets of tumors arising from stem and/or progenitor cells of the cerebellum. Recently, four distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have been identified [WNT (wingless), SHH (sonic hedgehog), Group 3, and Group 4]. Nearly all (90 %) of WNT patients have somatic missense mutations in CTNNB1 which promote protein stabilization. Alterations in SHH subgroup most often fall within the Shh signalling pathway. The most common are somatic or germline inactivating alterations or loss of PTCH1 and SUFU, or somatic missense mutations activating SMO. Group 3 tumors are characterized by MYC amplification resulting in high MYC mRNA expression levels compared with SHH and Group 4 tumors.The most frequently mutated somatic gene in Group 4 medulloblastoma is KDM6A, a histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase."
Nephroblastoma,H02301,"Nephroblastoma, also called Wilms tumor (WT), is the most common renal tumor of childhood. It can present as a single nodule, as multifocal unilateral lesions or as bilateral tumours. Typically, nephroblastoma comprises three histological components namely blastemal, epithelial and stromal. WT1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, was identified as the first nephroblastoma gene. Several other genes including CTNNB1, WTX, and TP53 have also been implicated in various stages of tumorigenesis of nephroblastoma."
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified",H02434,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS) is the most common type of DLBCL. DLBCL accounts for 30-40% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), making it the most prevalent form of NHL. DLBCL can occur as primary disease or through histologic transformation from other low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. The cell-of-origin (COO) determination based on gene expression profiling (GEP) subdivides most DLBCL, NOS patients into two main categories, namely germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. GCB subtype is characterized by frequent mutations in involved histone methylation or acetylation (EZH2, EP300), B-cell homing (GNA13, GNAI2), PI3K pathway signalling (PTEN), and apoptotic pathway (BCL2). In contrast, ABC subtype is driven by frequent mutations in the B cell receptor and NFKB pathways (CARD11, CD79a/CD79b, TNFAIP3 and MYD88)."
Bone marrow failure syndrome,H02529,Bone marrow failure syndromes are a heterogeneous group of life-threatening disorders characterized by the inability of the bone marrow to make an adequate number of mature blood cells.
Distal hereditary motor neuropathies,H00856,"Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that share the common feature of a length-dependent predominantly motor neuropathy. Many forms of dHMN have minor sensory abnormalities and/or a significant upper-motor-neuron component, and there is often an overlap with the axonal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) [DS: H00264 ] and with juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [DS: H00058 ] and hereditary spastic paraplegia [DS: H00266 ]. The causative genes with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked patterns of inheritance have implicated proteins with diverse functions. Distal HMN are classified into phenotypic subtypes according to age at onset, mode of inheritance, and presence of additional features."
Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia,H02031,"Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of muscle, brain, motor neurons and bone. Some cases are caused by mutations in the VCP gene, which encodes the AAA+ ATPase, a ubiquitin-dependent segregase. Recently, pathogenic mutations have been defined in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1."
Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,H02342,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are genetically heterogeneous disorders. Mutations in the several genes and a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene have been reported to be associated with both diseases (FTDALS). Genes linked to both diseases may converge into a common pathogenetic pathway, explaining the overlap of clinical symptoms."
Spinal muscular atrophy,H00455,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and paralysis. The most common form of SMA is caused by mutations of the SMN gene, that encodes the SMN protein, which regulates snRNP assembly. Four types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease: type I (Werdning-Hoffman), type II (intermediate), type III (Kugeleberg-Welander) and type IV (adult form). Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy are caused by mutation of other genes, some known and others not yet defined."
Wolfram syndrome,H00854,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder also known as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Two different categories of WFS (WFS1 and 2) are recognized, each with its own subset of variable symptoms, and resulting from mutations in the WFS1 and CISD2 genes, respectively. The WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-embedded protein. ERIS, the protein that CISD2 encodes, also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum."
Retinitis pigmentosa,H00527,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited progressive retinal diseases characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss and night vision difficulties. RP can be divided into syndromic (40 %) and non-syndromic (60 %) forms. The most frequent forms of syndromic RP are Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in more than 50 genes are known to cause non-syndromic RP. Non-syndromic RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner."
Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes,H00664,"Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes is a group of red cell disorders caused by inherited abnormality of glycolytic enzymes. Neurological phenotypes have been found to be associated only with specific mutations affecting TPI, PGK and, in rare cases, GPI. The symptoms of TPI deficiency are generally much more severe than those of any other glycolytic enzyme deficiency."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with structural brain abnormalities,H02470,Neurodevelopmental disorder (NED) with structural brain abnormalities is a group of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders. Most of them have complications in addition to microcephaly. Several underlying genetic causes of these diseases have been identified.
Primary open angle glaucoma,H00612,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, and a major cause of irreversible blindness. POAG is often accompanied by ocular hypertension and characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy of the optic nerve, and visual field loss. To date, at least 20 genetic loci for POAG have been reported. And four causative genes (CYP1B1, MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36) are identified from these loci. In addition, recently, heterozygous NTF4 mutation was associated with the phenotype in a small percentage of patients."
Paget disease of bone,H00437,"Paget disease of bone (PDB) are rare inherited osteolytic disorders that show phenotypic overlap. Patients with these diseases carry mutations in RANK/TNFRSF11A, OPG/TNFRSF11B or SQSTM1, resulting in activation of RANKL-RANK signaling axis with increases in bone resorption. Hearing impairment and tooth loss is common. Apart from juvenile-onset Paget's disease (PDB5), the condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait."
Distal myopathy,H00594,"Distal myopathies (MPD) are a group of heterogeneous inherited primary muscle disorders classified into one broad category due to the presentation of weakness involving the distal skeletal muscles. Clinical presentation is characterized by progressive muscular weakness and atrophy beginning in the hands, forearm, lower legs or feet. Currently almost 20 different entities of distal muscular dystrophies have been genetically determined. Half of the genes have been associated with distal phenotypes only, whereas the other genes can manifest also with other than distal phenotypes. Most of the genes code for structural and functional components of the sarcomere. The genes responsible for the pathologically defined category of myofibrillar myopathy are frequently display a distal phenotype."
Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles,H02586,Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. It has been reported that mutations in SQSTM1 cause this disease. SQSTM1 is an autophagic adaptor that shuttles aggregated and ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosome.
Infection-induced acute encephalopathy,H02536,"Infection-induced acute encephalopathy (IIAE) is a severe neurologic complication of an infection that usually occurs in children. It is characterized by a high-grade fever, often leading to coma, multiple-organ failure, brain edema, and high morbidity and mortality. The infections are usually viral, such as influenza, parainfluenza, and herpes simplex virus. It is possible that genetic factors play an important role in the aetiology of IIAE. For example, herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) has been linked to defects in type I interferon production downstream of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3."
Nasopharyngeal cancer,H00054,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare disease in most parts of the world, with an age-standardised annual incidence of less than 1 per 100000. However, in Southern China, parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean basin, NPC is an endemic disease with an incidence of 10-30 per 100000. Genome-wide studies have unravelled multiple chromosomal abnormalities with involvement of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Alterations of genes such as Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), p16/INK4A, p14/ARF suggest that multiple cellular pathways were dysregulated in the NPC cells. Studies on the precancerous lesions revealed early genetic changes and a critical role of Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) latent infection in the development of this cancer."
Follicular lymphoma,H01613,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. FL is characterized by diffuse lymphoadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly, and less commonly other extranodal sites of involvement. The genetic hallmark of FL, the translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), results in the constitutive overexpression of the bcl 2 protein, which impairs the normal germinal centre apoptotic programme. Inactivating mutations of MLL2 are found in >80% of FL and interfere with the ability of MLL2 to activate gene transcription through H3K4 methylation. Mutations of other histone modifiers (CREBBP, EZH2, MEF2B, and EP300) are found in ;33%, 27%, 15%, and 9% of FL, respectively."
Schizophrenia,H01649,"Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain."
Perry syndrome,H00879,"Perry syndrome is a rapidly progressive, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder. The cardinal symptoms consist of parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss and hypoventilation. At a molecular level, Perry syndrome is characterized by TDP-43 inclusions indicating a pathological overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and some forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Perry syndrome has recently been identified as being due to mutations in the DCTN1 gene, encoding the component of the dynactin complex."
Primary ciliary dyskinesia,H00564,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with recurrent oto-sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, and infertility owing to impaired motile ciliary function. Alterations in the left-right organization of the internal organ positioning, which is caused by dysfunctional nodal cilia in early developmental stage, occur in approximately 50% of PCD patients and this combination is referred as Kartagener syndrome."
Spermatogenic failure,H01282,"Spermatogenic failure is reflected in a lower or absent production of spermatozoa and is described by routine semen analysis using terms such as azoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia or asthenozoospermia. The genetic causes of spermatogenetic failure still remain largely unknown. It has been estimated that more than 2300 genes play a role in spermatogenesis."
Congenital mirror movements,H01287,"Mirror movements (MRMV) are involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements on the opposite side. While mirror movements are occasionally found in young children, persistence beyond the age of 10 is abnormal. Congenital mirror movements is a rare disorder that is mainly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Mutations in DCC, the gene encoding receptor for netrin 1 have been identified in MRMV patients. It has also been reported that RAD51 haploinsufficiency causes the heterogeneous MRMV."
Juvenile-onset dystonia,H01255,"Juvenile-onset dystonia, also known as Dystonia-deafness syndrome 1 (DDS1), is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a primarily dystonic phenotype of juvenile onset, caused by a mutation in one of the major forms of nonmuscle actin gene, ACTB, which is associated with a broad spectrum of developmental malformations and/or neurological abnormalities such as dystonia."
Baraitser-Winter syndrome,H02023,"Baraitser-Winter malformation syndrome (BWMS) is characterized by short stature, hypertelorism, bilateral ptosis, ocular coloboma, metopic ridging and agyria/pachygyria. Recently, it has been reported that BWMS is associated with missense mutations in one of the two cytoplasmic beta- and gamma- actin encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1."
Becker nevus syndrome,H02716,"Becker nevus syndrome (BNS) is a epidermal nevus syndrome characterized by the presence of a particular type of organoid epithelial nevus showing circumscribed hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis, and developmental abnormalities of different organ systems. It has been identified that mutations in ACTB, encoding for beta-actin, are associated with BNS."
"Deafness, autosomal dominant",H00604,"Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal-dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. Autosomal-dominant forms of deafness are usually post-lingual and progressive. Dominant mutations may be consistent with initial function and subsequent hearing loss owing to accumulation of pathology."
Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss,H01705,"Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) represents a rare disease entity, constituting less than 5 % of all sudden SNHL cases. Unlike unilateral disease, bilateral sudden SNHL appears to be mostly related to serious systemic pathology, and is associated with a more severe degree of hearing loss, poorer prognosis following treatment, and more significant impairment in morbidity and overall quality of life."
Essential tremor,H01577,"Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder that is considered to be one of the most common adult-onset movement disorders. ET is typically characterized by rhythmic, involuntary shaking of one or more parts of the body, and occurs exclusively during voluntary movements (action tremor) or in positions against gravity (postural tremor). The phenotypic severity of ET is variable, as evidenced by the existence of both highly disabling and milder forms of the disease. There are three subtypes of ET, namely hereditary, sporadic, and senile, and most studies indicate that ET is a hereditary disorder in more than half of affected individuals (and presumably has autosomal-dominant inheritance). The diagnostic approach includes obtaining a history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. At present, there are no validated serologic, radiologic, or pathological markers."
Nephrotic syndrome,H01657,"Nephrotic syndrome (NPHS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 grams per day), hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Calcineurin inhibitors with/without intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) constitute the standard treatment for SRNS. It has been reported that additional rituximab treatment combined with conventional MPT and immunosuppressive agents is a promising option."
Galloway-Mowat syndrome,H01722,"Galloway-Mowat Syndrome (GAMOS) is an autosomal recessively inherited condition characterized by the association of nephrotic syndrome and central nervous system involvement. Several case reports and studies on small series describing the clinical and histopathological features of GAMOS have revealed the clinical heterogeneity of this condition. The consistent morphological hallmark is microcephaly, which is often present at birth (primary microcephaly) but might also develop postnatally (secondary microcephaly). Major brain abnormalities include cerebral atrophy and neural-migration defects, such as agyria, microgyria, or polymicrogyria. These structural brain abnormalities are associated with severe psychomotor impairment, hypotonia, and seizures in half of all cases. The nephrotic syndrome occurs in the first four months of life with an average of three months, and a congenital nephrotic syndrome has rarely been described. This nephrotic syndrome is steroid-resistant and associated with a constant and rapid deterioration of renal function. Death usually occurs within few years from the onset. Very recently, several genes have been identified as the cause of GAMOS."
Ovarian dysgenesis,H00599,"Ovarian dysgenesis (ODG), also known as 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis, is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by lack of spontaneous pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, uterine hypoplasia, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a result of streak gonads."
Primary microcephaly,H00269,Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by reduced skull circumference and brain volume.
Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis,H01177,"Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN) is a neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical degeneration of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and occasionally the globus pallidus, with little involvement of the rest of the brain. The clinical features of IBSN include developmental regression, choreoathetosis, dystonia, spasticity, dysphagia, failure to thrive, nystagmus, optic atrophy, and mental retardation. The mechanism of IBSN has not been elucidated, although it has been reported that IBSN usually occurs as a result of metabolic, familial, or toxic diseases. Mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene (complex V) have been described in families with mitochondrial inheritance, while there is much evidence that supports the role of the mutation in NUP62 as the cause of autosomal recessive IBSN. Human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) infection has been reported to associated with this disease."
Atrial fibrillation,H00731,"Atrial fibrillation (AF, ATFB) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is regarded generally as a sporadic, acquired disorder. Nevertheless, recent growing evidence points to an important heritable basis for AF. By linkage analysis, several loci have been mapped for monogenetic AF. Some of these loci encode for subunits of potassium channels."
Fetal akinesia deformation sequence,H00987,"Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired fetal movement and resulting developmental defects. Fetal movement is essential for normal fetal development and growth. Intrauterine movement restriction causes growth retardation, congenital limb contractures, pterygia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hydramnios."
Lethal congenital contractural syndrome,H00865,"Lethal congenital contractural syndrome (LCCS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by congenital nonprogressive joint contractures with a severe form of arthrogryposis. LCCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It has a worldwide incidence, but it is more common in isolated populations, such as Finland and the Bedouin community in Israel. Several mutations associated with LCCS have been reported."
Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease,H01030,"Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (CAAHD), formerly known as lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (LAAHD), is a condition with fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), multiple contractures and facial anomalies. Motor neuron loss is also present in patients with CAAHD."
Huntington disease,H00059,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length Htt is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+erload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility. N-terminal fragments containing the polyQ stretch translocate to the nucleus where they impair transcription and induce neuronal death."
Williams-Beuren syndrome,H01439,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare autosomal dominant multisystem disorder associated with the hemizygous deletion of a number of genes on chromosome 7q11.23. The range of phenotypes may include congenital vascular and heart disease, characteristic facial features, premature aging, generally mild mental retardation, short stature, myopathy, hypercalcemia, and a unique cognitive profile. To date at least 28 genes have been identified within the deleted region."

OFD type I is a male lethal disorder and due to mutations in the OFD1 gene on the X chromosome. OFD type IV is due to mutations in the TCTN3 gene and patients have tibial dysplasia. OFD type V is due to mutations in the DDX59 gene and patients show the core features of cleft palate, lobulated tongue, and polydactyly."
Hereditary gingival fibromatosis,H01250,"Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (GINGF) is a rare autosomal dominant overgrowth condition characterized by a benign, slowly progressive, nonhemorrhagic, fibrous enlargement of maxillary and mandibular keratinized gingiva. Four gene loci have been mapped for autosomal dominant GINGF. Although the molecular basis of GINGF remains largely unknown, a SOS1 gene mutation is identified. Recently, it has been reported that REST final-exon-truncating mutations cause GINGF."
Chromosome 15q24 microdeletion syndrome,H01861,"Chromosome 15q24 microdeletion syndrome is a rare microdeletion syndrome characterized by growth retardation, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features including long face with high anterior hairline, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downslanting palpebral fissures, sparse and broad medial eyebrows, broad and/or depressed nasal bridge, small mouth, long smooth philtrum, and full lower lip. Other common findings include skeletal and digital abnormalities, genital abnormalities in males, hypotonia, behavior problems, recurrent infections, and eye problems. The recurrent deletions of chromosome 15q24 result from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) mediated by low-copy repeat (LCR, also called segmental duplication) clusters. The deletion occurred as a de novo event in all known cases. Recent study has identified that haploinsufficiency of SIN3A (chromosome 15q24.2) is associated with mild syndromic intellectual disability. This phenotype is highly related to that of individuals with atypical 15q24 microdeletions, linking SIN3A to this microdeletion syndrome."
Hypertriglyceridemia,H01637,"Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a condition with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in blood continuing to rise. HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS: H00153 ], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS: H00156 ]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk."
Osteogenesis imperfecta,H00506,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is characterized by an inherited bone fragility mainly caused by mutations in type I collagen. Poor teeth development, blue sclerae and hearing impairment also manifest in individuals with OI. Mutations in the other genes have been recently identified."
Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxias,H01891,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (SCAR) are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders that affect the cerebellum, the spinocerebellar and sensory tracts of the spinal cord and often the sensory nerves. They may present as a pure cerebellar syndrome or are associated with neurological symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, dystonia, chorea, cognitive impairment, optic atrophy, seizures or extra neurological symptoms such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus in Friedreich ataxia. The main clinical features are staggering gait with frequent falls, upper limb dysmetria, impairment of speech, dysphagia, and abnormalities of eye movement."
Machado-Joseph disease,H01478,"Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is one of the most common hereditary ataxias and is distributed worldwide. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, involving predominantly the cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron and oculomotor systems. Minor, but more specific, features such as external progressive ophthalmoplegia (EPO), dystonia, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, as well as bulging eyes, may also be of major importance for the clinical diagnosis of MJD. The mean age at onset is around 40 years. MJD is associated with CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene. CAG repeat varies in size among affected persons. There is no effective treatment of ataxia. Case series and small controlled trials of several medications including antianxiolytics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics have shown limited efficacy."
Episodic ataxias,H00749,"Episodic ataxias (EAs) are a group of rare autosomal-dominant diseases characterized by recurrent, discrete episodes of ataxia, giddiness, and vertigo. EA1 and EA2 are the most widely recognized of the autosomal-dominant EAs and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. There are central and peripheral nervous system manifestations in both conditions. The current classification is based on genetics and actually includes seven distinct subtypes. But these variants other than EA1 and EA2 are rare, some only occurring in single families, and gene mutations have not been identified in all. It is quite likely, however, that the number of phenotypes and mutated genes will grow further."
Hemiplegic migraine,H00775,"Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraines (SHM and FHM) are rare paroxysmal disorders characterized by motor aura and headache. The distinction is based on whether at least one first or second degree relative is also affected, otherwise the diagnostic criteria are similar. The majority of FHM families have a mutation in one of the ion channels CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A. SHM is sometimes caused by a de novo mutation in one of the genes. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified."
Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome,H01808,"Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) syndrome is a rare condition involving sudden and prolonged unilateral seizures in infancy and early childhood, followed by hemiplegia. The prolonged focal motor seizure usually occurs during the course of a febrile illness and is followed by hemiplegia ipsilateral to the side of convulsions. Although hemiplegia is usually permanent, it may disappear in about 20% of cases. Some patients with familial hemiplegic migraine and manifesting the S218L mutation in CACNA1A were reported to experience severe attacks with unilateral cerebral edema after trivial head trauma. It has shown that CACNA1A associate with HHE and familial hemiplegic migraine, and suggested that similar pathogenic mechanisms may underlie these two disorders."
Familial epilepsy temporal lobe (ETL),H00809,"Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is an inherited epilepsy syndrome characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood of lateral temporal seizures with predominant auditory symptoms originating from the lateral temporal lobe cortex. Mutations in the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene have been reported in up to 50% of ADTLE/ADPEAF pedigrees. In addition, de novo LGI1 mutations are found in about 2% of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with ADLTE/ADPEAF but have no family history."
"Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ)",H01204,"Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ) is autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous conditions characterized by early onset of cerebellar ataxia and MR. Patients with CAMRQs have a severe disturbance of posture and balance, strabismus, muscular hypotonia during childhood and they have a delayed ability to walk independently. The disease is also characterized by perceptual difficulties and in most cases mild mental retardation. Four subtypes have been mapped so far."
Cerebral cavernous malformation,H00534,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are vascular malformations of the central nervous system comprising enlarged caverns with a single layer of endothelium, which easily lead to cerebral hemorrhages. The disease present as either sporadic or autosomal dominant conditions and is linked to three genes KRIT1, MGC4607, and PDCD10. Mutations in KRIT1 impair its interaction with ICAP-1 alpha, and influence beta 1 integrin-dependent angiogenesis."
"Congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi",H01912,"Congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi (CLOVE) syndrome is a recently delineated disorder that comprises vascular malformations (typically truncal), dysregulated adipose tissue, scoliosis, enlarged bony structures (typically of the legs) without progressive or distorting bony overgrowth. The key feature of this syndrome is a truncal lipomatous mass of variable size that is noted at birth. The fatty growths often extend from the trunk into the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, thoracic cavity, and epidural space. Deeper fast-flow and slow-flow vascular anomalies become evident early in childhood. Most acral deformities become accentuated with growth, are often symmetrical, are not rapidly progressive, and are commonly misdiagnosed as Proteus syndrome. This syndrome is caused by somatic activating mutations in PIK3CA."
Desmoplastic small round cell tumor,H01985,"Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare tumor typically involving peritoneum. The concept of DSRCT as a distinct tumor has been strengthened by association with a specific chromosomal abnormality, t(11;22)(p13;q12) that involves the EWSR1 and WT1 genes. EWSR1 encodes the EWS protein which is a member of the FET family of RNA-binding proteins, while WT1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor. Several transcriptional targets of the EWSR1-WT1 chimera have been identified such as Platelet Derived Growth Factor A (PDGFA), IL2 receptor-beta, Myeloid Leukemia Factor 1 (MLF1) or Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R). Somatic MET and PIK3CA mutations have also been identified."
Megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome,H02153,"Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome is a rare overgrowth syndrome. The main symptoms are progressive megalencephaly, polymicrogyria, capillary malformations, syndactyly, and connective tissue dysplasia. Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in MCAP patients."
CLAPO syndrome,H02297,"CLAPO syndrome is a rare vascular disorder characterized by capillary malformation of the lower lip, lymphatic malformation predominant on the face and neck, asymmetry, and partial/generalized overgrowth. CLAPO is caused by activating mutations in PIK3CA."
Macrodactyly,H02647,"Macrodactyly is a discrete congenital anomaly consisting of enlargement of all tissues localized to the terminal portions of a limb. Macrodactyly is attributed to a somatic mutation in PIK3CA, a component of the mTOR pathway-related overgrowth disorders."
Activated PI3K-delta syndrome,H01387,"Activated PI3K-delta syndrome (APDS) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, progressive airway damage, lymphopenia, increased circulating transitional B cells, increased immunoglobulin M, and reduced immunoglobulin G2 levels in serum and impaired vaccine responses. A dominant gain-of-function mutation has been found in the p110-delta protein, the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K-delta), encoded by the PIK3CD gene."
Roifman-Chitayat syndrome,H02585,"Roifman-Chitayat syndrome (ROCHIS) is a combined immunodeficiency, characterized by facial dysmorphism, optic nerve atrophy, skeletal anomalies, myoclonic seizures, and substantial developmental delays. It has been reported that dual loss of PIK3CD and KNSTRN expression causes this syndrome."
Meningioma,H01556,"Meningiomas are the second-most common central nervous system tumor in adults. These tumors arise from arachnoid cells of the meninges, the covering layer of the brain. The majority of meningiomas tend to be benign, localized, and non-invasive. However, some meningiomas tend to be more aggressive with tendencies toward invasion of the surrounding brain, high propensity for recurrence, and in rare cases extracranial metastasis. Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology. Recently, novel mutations have been discovered in non-NF2 meningiomas. The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas."
Proteus syndrome,H02119,"Proteus syndrome (PS) is a generally severe but highly variable disorder caused by an activating AKT1 mutation. The diagnosis of PS requires fulfillment of three general criteria: sporadic occurrence, mosaic distribution of lesions, and a progressive course in addition to various specific criteria. These specific manifestations include, but are not limited to, cerebriform connective tissue nevus, linear epidermal nevus, asymmetric, disproportionate overgrowth, dysregulated adipose tissue, vascular malformations, and lung cysts."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus,H00409,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance of peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue) and insufficient compensatory insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Both insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are thought to result from the complex interplay of many different pathways under the combined control of environmental and genetic factors. It is accepted that T2DM results from population aging and adverse environmental factors of the modern world which favor the development of obesity."
Familial partial lipodystrophy,H00420,"Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable loss of body fat from the extremities as well as from the truncal region. LMNA, PPARG and AKT2 have been identified in association with FPL. However, it is not yet known how these genes cause the disorder. Besides them, additional loci are likely as many FPL patients do not reveal any mutations in these genes. LMNA mutations may affect nuclear function, and may be involved in apoptosis and premature cell death of adipocytes, thus causing lipodystrophy. PPARG, PLIN1, and AKT2 are regulators of adipocyte differentiation. AKT2 is also involved in postreceptor insulin signaling. Thus, mutations in these three genes could result in lipodystrophy. The reason why loss of fat is restricted to partial areas remains unknown. Recently, novel autosomal recessive causes of partial lipodystrophy were reported."
Hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia with hemihypertrophy,H01909,"Hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia with hemihypertrophy (HIHGHH) is characterized by hemihypertrophy without any other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [DS: H00713 ] and persistent hypoketotic, hypofattyacidemic hypoinsulinaemic hypoglycemia with no detectable incompletely processed high molecular weight IGF-II precursor proteins or insulin autoantibodies. There is no evidence of increased glucose clearance from the circulation. Patients have been found to carry a de novo mutation in the serine/threonine kinase AKT2."
Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome,H01885,"Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH) is rare overgrowth disorder. MCAP [DS: H02153 ] and MPPH show very similar symptoms; the main symptoms are progressive megalencephaly, polymicrogyria, capillary malformations, syndactyly, and connective tissue dysplasia in the former, and progressive megalencephaly, polymicrogyria, and polydactyly in the latter. Polydactyly in MPPH seems to be a variable feature presenting with varied severity in both upper and lower limbs. MCAP and MPPH have been shown to result from gain-of-function mutations in the mTOR-pathway."
Syndromic intellectual developmental disorder,H02463,Syndromic intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) is a group of disorders characterized by intellectual disability presented together with additional features such as facial dysmorphisms or congenital anomalies. Several underlying genetic causes of these disorders have been identified.
Neurodevelopmental disorder with histone modification defect,H02803,"Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, including histone modification, play critical roles in cell differentiation and organ development through spatial and temporal gene regulation. Many neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the histone modification machinery have been reported."
Prion disease,H00061,"Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC."
Huntington disease-like syndrome,H01243,"Huntington disease (HD), which is caused by a triplet-repeat expansion in the IT15 gene (also known as huntingtin or HD), accounts for about 90% of cases of chorea of genetic etiology. In recent years, several other distinct genetic disorders have been identified that can present with a clinical picture indistinguishable from HD, termed HD-like (HDL) syndromes. So far, four genes associated with HDL syndromes have been identified, including the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2) and, the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (HDL4)."
Central core disease,H00699,"Central core disease (CCD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by central cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. CCD is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but recessive inheritance has been recently described in few families. The clinical phenotype of dominantly inherited CCD is variable but usually mild and non-progressive; however, more severe forms including the fetal akinesia syndrome have also been reported associated with recessive or de novo dominant mutations. CCD typically presents in infancy with hypotonia and motor developmental delay and is characterized by predominantly proximal weakness pronounced in the hip girdle. CCD is due to mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, encoding the principal skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR1). Altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeostasis within muscle cells due to mutation-induced conformational changes of the RyR protein are considered the main pathogenetic mechanisms."
Multi-minicore disease,H01310,"Multi-minicore Disease (MmD) is a recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by multiple cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. It is morphologically defined by localized multiple areas of mitochondrial depletion and sarcomere disorganization, running to a limited extent along the longitudinal axis of muscle fiber (""minicores""). Marked clinical variability corresponds to genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in the SEPN1 gene have been identified in patients with the classic axial phenotype characterized by spinal rigidity, early scoliosis, and respiratory impairment, whereas mutations in the RYR1 gene have been associated with a wider range of clinical features comprising external ophthalmoplegia, distal weakness and wasting or predominant hip girdle involvement."
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,H00293,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death."
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,H01019,Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a highly lethal form of inherited primary electrical myocardial disease characterized by exercise- and stress-related adrenergic ventricular tachycardia without structural cardiac abnormalities. It manifests as syncope and sudden death and can be caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) accounting for an autosomal dominant form (CPVT1) or mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene CASQ2 accounting for an autosomal recessive form (CPVT2).
Congenital generalized lipodystrophy,H00419,"Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by near total absence of adipose tissue from birth. Several metabolic alterations in carbohydrate (diabetes mellitus) and lipid metabolism and involvement of heart, bone and ovaries are also observed in this disease. Patients typically have low serum levels of leptin and adiponectin. Several genes were studied to identify the molecular alteration responsible for CGL, which have been found to contribute to lipid droplet formation in adipocytes."
Primary pulmonary hypertension,H01619,"Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a progressive disease characterised by raised pulmonary vascular resistance, which results in diminished right-heart function due to increased right ventricular afterload. PPH occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged women; mean survival from onset of symptoms is 2-3 years. Mutations in the type II bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor (BMPR)-II are now considered to be the genetic basis for familial PPH and ~30% of cases of sporadic PPH. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and affect intracellular signalling via Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinases. It has been shown that missense mutations of cysteine residues in the extracellular or kinase domain of BMPR2 result in intracellular localisation of the mutated receptor and negligible Smad signalling."
Pulmonary arterial hypertension,H01621,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH."
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,H00292,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM/CMH) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction."
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1C,H00567,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of myopathies characterized by a progressive weakness of the pelvic and shoulder girdle musculature. It has been reported that loss-of-function mutations in caveolin-3 gene are associated with a form of muscular dystrophy, LGMD1C. Caveolins are the principal protein components of caveolae which represent appendages or sub-compartments of plasma membranes."
Rippling muscle disease,H02179,"Rippling muscle disease (RMD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder of skeletal muscle characterized by signs of increased muscle irritability, such as percussion-induced rapid contraction (PIRC), percussion-induced muscle mounding (PIMM), and/or electrically silent muscle contractions (rippling muscle). Many cases of RMD are caused by mutations in caveolin-3, and aberrations in the tubular system are commonly observed."
Idiopathic hyperCKemia,H02181,"Persistent elevation of serum creatine kinase (hyperCKemia) in individuals with normal neurological and laboratory examinations has been called idiopathic hyperCKemia. HyperCKemia usually accompanies muscle weakness in patients with myopathies, but it may also be found in subjects with a normal neurological examination. This condition is labeled asymptomatic or isolated hyperCKemia and may be due to subclinical or preclinical neuromuscular disorders, dystrophinopathy carrier state, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, alcoholism, or intake of statins and other drugs. When the cause is not found, even after extensive investigations, the condition is defined as idiopathic hyperCKemia. Mutations in the human CAV3 gene, leading to reduced expression of caveolin-3, which is the major muscle-specific caveolar protein, may result in hyperCKemia."
"Distal myopathy, Tateyama type",H02182,"Distal myopathy, Tateyama type is a peculiar form of distal myopathy associated with reduced caveolin-3 in muscle fibers in which the muscle atrophy is restricted to the small muscles of the hands and feet. Gene analysis has been disclosed heterozygous mutations in the caveolin-3 gene."
IFN-gamma/IL-12 axis,H00089,"The interferon-gamma-interleukin-12 axis is critical for defense against intracellular microbes such as mycobacteria, salmonella, and listeria. Mutations in either chain of the IFN-gammaR lead to severe susceptibility to mycobacteria and are very difficult to treat. Mutations in IL-12p40 or IL-12R beta 1 are milder clinically and can be treated with IFN-gamma because that receptor is still intact. Complete recessive mutations in STAT1 are more severe than any of the others because they affect both IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha signaling."
Chronic granulomatous disease,H00098,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by impaired activation of the NADPH oxidase activity in phagocytic cells, resulting in the inability of these cells to generate toxic oxygen radicals and hence to kill catalase-positive bacteria. The NADPH oxidase is composed of four polypeptide subunits and mutations in the corresponding genes (gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox) are responsible for the four different genetic subgroups of CGD. Most cases (65%) involve mutations in gp91phox and are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The remainder are autosomal recessive (AR)."
Granulibacter infection,H01167,"Granulibacter is a gram-negative acetic acid bacterium that is recently reported to be a human opportunistic pathogen. Granulibacter has been isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, in which phagocytes are not able to produce bactericidal superoxide anions. Bacteremia has also been observed in a non-immunocompromised patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse."
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency,H00099,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which neutrophils fail to mobilize and migrate to sites of injury. At least three genetically distinct forms of this group of disorders have been described: LAD I, II, and III. Defects in the expression of beta2-integrins and fucose- containing proteins account for LAD-I and LAD-II, respectively. In LAD-III integrin expression by leukocytes is normal, but the integrins fail to generate high avidity for their cognate endothelial-cell ligands. Mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3), a gene that encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with cytoplasmic tails of beta-integrins in hematopoietic cells, is the cause of LAD-III. Dominant-negative mutations resulting in deficiency of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac2), the predominant hematopoeitic-specific Rho GTPase in neutrophils also leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and skeletal anomalies,H02460,Neurodevelopmental disorder (NED) with dysmorphic facies and skeletal anomalies is a group of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of them have complications in addition to dysmorphic facies and skeletal anomalies. Several underlying genetic causes of these diseases have been identified.
Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome,H02635,"Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome (POBINDS) is associated with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. It has been reported that mutations in CSNK2B cause this syndrome. CSNK2B encodes the beta subunit of casein kinase II (CK2), plays an important role in neuron morphology and synaptic transmission."
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,H00002,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a clonal stem cell malignancy of excessive lymphoblast proliferation. It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). T-ALL comprises 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes. These oncogenic transcription factors include T-cell leukaemia homeobox protein 1 (TLX1 also known as HOX11), TLX3 (HOX11L2), LYL1, TAL1 and MLL."
Aortic valve disease,H00554,"Aortic valve disease (AOVD), also known as bicuspid aortic valve, is the most common congenital heart defect with strong male predominance. It may arise in isolation or in association with other congenital heart lesions. The bicuspid aortic valve is typically made of two unequal-sized leaflets, whereas the normal valve is known to have three leaflets."
Adams-Oliver syndrome,H01413,"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare condition defined by the combination of aplasia cutis congenita (ACC), characterized by scalp and skull lesions, and transverse limb abnormalities. Mutations in ARHGAP31 (AOS1), RBPJ (AOS3) and NOTCH1 (AOS5) cause autosomal dominant AOS. Mutations in DOCK6 (AOS2) and EOGT (AOS4) result in autosomal recessive AOS."
Idiopathic generalized epilepsies,H00808,"Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (EIG) are the most common types of epilepsy in childhood and adolescence. Based on the main seizure type and age at onset, four classic subsyndromes exist: childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. Although autosomal dominant inheritance occurs in rare families, clinical genetic data indicate that complex inheritance involving two or more genes is likely in the majority of families."
Childhood absence epilepsy,H02215,"Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE/ECA) is a common idiopathic generalized epilepsy, accounts for 10% to 12% of epilepsy in children under 16 years of age. This condition begins in childhood with absences, which are brief episodes of loss of consciousness. It has been reported that mutations in several genes encoding subunits of the GABAA receptor are associated with this disease."
Focal cortical dysplasia of Taylor,H01251,Focal cortical dysplasia of Taylor (FCDT) is a subtype of cortical displasias. FCDT is characterized by epilepsy associated malformations that are often composed of balloon cells and dysplastic neurons. It has been found that inherited mutations in the TSC1 gene can cause this disorder.
Smith-Kingsmore syndrome,H01928,"Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (SKS), also known as macrocephaly-intellectual disability-neurodevelopmental disorder-small thorax syndrome (MINDS syndrome), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder. Heterozygous mutations in MTOR gene have been shown to underlie SKS. The most consistent findings in SKS are intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay, megalencephaly, and seizures. There is moderate clinical variability, ranging from patients with macrocephaly, mild ID, and no convulsions, to severe forms in patients with intractable epilepsy, megalencephaly, severe ID, and autistic spectrum disorder."
You-Hoover-Fong syndrome,H01789,"You-Hoover-Fong syndrome is an autosomal-recessive syndromic form of intellectual disability. It has been reported that compound heterozygous variants in TELO2 were found from six affected individuals from four families with intellectual disability and neurological and other congenital abnormalities, suggesting that these TELO2 variants result in loss of function and cause this disease."
Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly,H02461,Neurodevelopmental disorder (NED) with microcephaly is a group of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders. Most of them have complications in addition to microcephaly. Several underlying genetic causes of these diseases have been identified.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,H02610,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world, affecting the pharynx, larynx and oral cavity. It is well known that smoking and alcohol abuse are major risk factors for HNSCC. Additionally, human papillomavirus infection is another implicated risk factor. Although lifestyle factors account for the majority of HNSCCs, genetic alterations will cause some individuals to be more sensitive to these environmental factors."
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,H02418,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies worldwide. NHL includes malignant tumors of the lymphoid tissues variously resulting from the clonal growth of B cells, T cells and natural killer cells. NHL can be broadly classified based on the type of lymphocyte involved: B lymphocyte (B cell) or T lymphocyte (T cell) and is further classified by other factors, including whether it is aggressive or indolent. Aggressive NHL is fast-growing disease. It mainly includes mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. On the other hand, indolent NHL is slow-growing disease. It mainly includes follicular lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and MALT lymphoma."
